> SV = (# * $ * %)/L

*#* = Opps Created

Why use created dates instead of close dates?

<i>...because created dates are static and close dates change constantly or move into the past.</i>

---

> SV = (# * $ * %)/L

*$* = Average Deal Value

How do we account for deals with non-annual lengths?

<i>...DO convert multi-year deals to annual contract values and DON'T convert multi-month deals to an annualized value.</i>

---

> SV = (# * $ * %)/L

*L* = Average Deal Length

How do we make sure to capture the correct deal length?

<i>...automate the creation of opportunities so that no deal gets created too late and enforce a 'nurture to close' policy so that no deal ages artificially.</i>

## Now To The More Complex...

>% Win Rate

---

## Win Rate Has It's Own Equation

>Won Deals/ Total Opportunities (Won + Lost)

___

## Again, Seems Easy Right?

Again, Not exactly

---

> Win Rate = Won Deals/Total Opportunities

Won Deals is straightforward but Total Opportunites is not as simple as Won + Lost in most businesses.

___

> Win Rate = Won Deals/Total Opportunities

Total Opportunites = (Won + Lost) - (Disqualified + Nurture)

The key concept here is that neither your business nor your salespeople should get penalized for disqualified or nurture opportunities.

If you put a good nurture policy in place, e.g. 30 days for SMB, 60 days for Midmarket, 90 days for Enterprise then many of them will likely move into a Closed Lost stage.
