## Opportunity Creation

1. ALL 'Qualification Calls' require a created opportunity for tracking purposes even if being sent immediately to a Disqualified stage.
2. Use a process builder to automate.

 Reason for why you need to create an opportunity for all calls that are setup by or for a salesperson? Account-based activity and disqualification tracking. It's harder to do with leads in the mix.

## Define DQ & Nurture Policies

- [Disqualification](https://www.insightsquared.com/2016/04/the-importance-of-disqualifying-leads/) removes bad opportunities from your % win rate calculation.
- Nurture policy* ensures that opportunities are on loan, not owned.<br><br>
 <small>*e.g. 30 days for SMB, 60 days for Midmarket, 90 days for Enterprise...automatically send to Closed Lost and create new opportunity if needed.</small>

Salespeople do not OWN opportunities. They RENT them from your company.
