## One-Time Setup

1. Modify pipeline stages in CRM (if needed)
2. Define process for opportunity creation
3. Create custom formula fields
4. Enrich accounts with segment data (if needed)

<small><b>Note:</b> Segment data includes company size, industry, or location. If you're not selling into different company sizes, industries, or location then one-time setup and ongoing maintenance should be straightforward.</small>
